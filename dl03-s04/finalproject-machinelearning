Final Project Report – Machine Learning Model
Project Goal:
Design a machine learning model to predict whether oils should be added to or removed from a list based on textual features, using neural networks.

Execution Steps:
Stage	Description
File Processing	Converted the .txt file to CSV format for analysis using pandas
Data Encoding	Used LabelEncoder to transform text features into numeric form
Data Splitting	Divided the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 ratio)
Built Two Separate Models	One using the sigmoid activation function, and the other with relu, for comparison
Model Training	Trained both models with SGD optimizer and mean_squared_error loss over 10 epochs
Loss Visualization	Plotted loss curves to observe model learning behavior

Model Comparison:
Feature	Model 1 (sigmoid)	Model 2 (relu)
Architecture	6 Dense layers	6 Dense layers
Activation	sigmoid	relu
Capacity	Moderate (units: 30 & 50)	Higher (units: 30, 15 & 3×100)
Loss Reduction	Slower, less efficient	Faster, more effective
Overall Result	Sluggish learning	Stronger performance in prediction

 Conclusion:
•	Data preprocessing and model construction were done thoroughly and correctly.
•	The second model with ReLU performed significantly better thanks to deeper architecture and more effective activation.
•	Training with the basic SGD optimizer resulted in a gradual loss drop—using Adam or RMSprop could lead to faster and better learning.
•	The loss plot clearly shows that the ReLU-based model is a better candidate for future use.
